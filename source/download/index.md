## Adding Hitchy To Your Project

Hitchy is published via [npm](http://npmjs.org) and so getting it is as easy as running the following command from inside your project's folder:

```
npm install --save hitchy
```

This will install Hitchy core framework as dependency of your application to be. Since the core doesn't help with what you want it to you probably will have to install extensions to Hitchy as well.

## Requirements

Running Hitchy-based application does not require to hitch it onto some other framework such as Express though using Express is optionally supported. For the sake of testing Hitchy standalone mode was added from the very first beginning. And as it turns out running standalone is a suitable option in many more situations.
