title: Why Hitchy?

We love [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org). We love [Express](http://expressjs.com). It is a popular but minimalistic framework. We also love richer frameworks like [Sails](http://sailsjs.org). But these usually come with downsides we don't love. 

We also love to keep good software as-is. Never touch a running system. Thus we were looking for some framework to build web applications that can be integrated into existing software or _hitched_ to it. Hitchy is our approach of a less minimalistic framework to achieve that ... though it's working pretty well on its own either.
