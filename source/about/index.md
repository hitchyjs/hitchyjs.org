Hitchy is just another (web) application framework: it's equivalent to several existing frameworks of its like, but still it tries to overcome some downsides of framework we've been working with before. Hitchy is built up on things we like to work with and tries to reproduce issues we've been having with other frameworks previously.

## What We Like

* promises
* ES6 in general
* core supporting modularization
* little footprint when it comes to depending on third-party extensions

## Issues We'd Like to Overcome

* ODM lacking support for transaction-based modifications
* code wasting time
* code struggling with core principles of Javascript
* monolithic architecture to instantly solve everyone's problem
