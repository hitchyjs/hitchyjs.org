## Knowing Your Tool

Hitchy relies on a [convention-over-configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) design. This means that Hitchy is expecting certain pattern in code rather than supporting configuration to explicitly choose one out of several possible options. This section tries to introduce the most basic concepts to obey when developing with and for Hitchy.
