# Flexible Extensions

Hitchy spends a lot of efforts on 

* discovering its context by means of existing files and folders and available extensions.
* resolving dependencies between discovered extensions e.g. resulting in a calculated order of processing extensions' code.
* supporting hooks for calling code of discovered extensions in several moments of your application's life-cycle as well as on handling requests.

There is a different chapter discussing Hitchy's extension handling in full extent.
